# Goun

Goun is a structured-based process model interpreter. It takes a process model (such as Petri Net) as input, and outputs the descriptions of the model.

You can refer to the CAiSE 2017 paper “[***Structural Descriptions of Process Models Based on Goal-Oriented Unfolding***](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-59536-8_25 "***Structural Descriptions of Process Models Based on Goal-Oriented Unfolding***")” for more details.

## Overview

- code/ 
  contains the source codes.
- data/ 
  contains the raw and processed process models used for evaluating our approach.

### Reqirements:

* Java-1.8.0 or Python-3.0
